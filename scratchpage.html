        <p>Above is a link to my resume, this should prove my ability to have an expert opinion on a book series.</p>
        <p> <br> Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
    </div>

 <div class="common rightmenu">
        <p>This is all my professional opinion on both series as I have read every single book in each series. I have also read Sarah J
            Maas's third series, Crescent City, so I have read every single book written by Sarah J Maas making me somewhat of an expert 
            regarding her work.

       <p class="justify bold"> Alrighty folks, listen up. I could go on and on about this topic, however, I will keep my thoughts brief, and thus, in condensed bullet points below. Enjoy.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="resumeListHeading"> <span class="bold" style="font-style: italic;">Throne of Glass</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>ALEIN > Feyre. Are we kidding?? Alein is infintely better than weak crybaby Feyre.</li>
                    <li>Rowan > Rhysand. Not even a competition. Rowan is the ultimate book boyfriend, he is perfection.</li>
                    <li>Talk about character development! From book 1 to book 8 the amount of growth each of the characters experiences is insane. I'll never shut up about it.</li>
                    <li>Never have I ever been so connected to a group of characters to the point that I am brought to tears at not only their heartbreak but their successes. So in awe of my love for these characters.</li>
                    <li>Alein deserves another bullet point because she is genuinely the most amazing character to ever exist. She is beyond brilliant and witty and clever and strong and fierce and loyal and loving and brave and everything good in the world. I want to be her when I grow up.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="resumeListHeading"><span class="bold" style="font-style: italic;">A Court of Thorns and Roses</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>The only redeeming characters in this series are the bat boys. The Archerson sisters are genuinely the most annoying females I have ever had to read about. Ever.</li>
                    <li>Medicore plot line all based around the main characters slow burn until they cave and have sex.</li>
                    <li>Only getting Feyre's point of view for the first 4 books? Boring. So boring. Because Feyre is boring.</li>
                    <li>Shifting after 4 books from Feyre's pov to Nesta and Cassian's was jarring and akin to whiplash. Not thought through in the slightest (nothing againt SJM I love her with my whole heart and she is so brilliant but acotar is not her best work and I don't blame her for falling into the popular smutty book trend since that makes money).</li>
                    <li>The books are huge and yet it feels like the events that take place could have been summed up in way fewer pages? Don't get me wrong, I love a big book, if the big book has many things developing.</li>
                </ul>
